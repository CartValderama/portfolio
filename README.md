# Portfolio Project

This project is a portfolio template designed to help you showcase your work in a clean, minimalist, yet creatively engaging manner. The aim is to create a simple and effective template that can be easily customized, while also serving as a learning exercise for key web development skills.

## Project Goals

- **Create a Simple and Elegant Portfolio Template:** Design a minimalist portfolio that balances simplicity with creativity. The template should be easy to navigate and visually appealing, allowing your work to stand out.
- **Practice Git Source Control:** Use Git throughout the project to manage changes, track progress, and collaborate if necessary.

## Learning Outcomes

By completing this project, you will achieve the following:

- **Understand the Differences Between Server-Side and Client-Side Components in Next.js:** Learn when and how to use server-side rendering (SSR) versus client-side rendering (CSR) to optimize performance and user experience.
- **Master Typescript:** Enhance your JavaScript skills by integrating TypeScript, providing better type safety and reducing errors during development.
- **Explore Framer Motion:** Gain hands-on experience with Framer Motion, a powerful library for adding animations to your React components, making the portfolio more interactive and visually dynamic.
- **Utilize React's Observer Hook:** Learn how to leverage the `useEffect` and `IntersectionObserver` hooks to create responsive, performance-efficient components.
- **Apply React Context:** Understand how to use React Context for state management, allowing you to pass data through the component tree without having to pass props manually at every level.
- **Create Custom Hooks:** Develop custom hooks to encapsulate and reuse logic across components, improving code modularity and readability.
